And it's fastâ€”extremely so in some trims. Like all Teslas, the Model 3 carries its battery under the floor, resulting in a low center of gravity. The 60 mph time for the Model 3 Long Range in our test was 4.1 seconds.",

The acceleration of the two models ranges from outstanding to unbelievable. The standard Model S has proven itself an agile sports sedan with well-controlled body motions and direct steering. The Tesla Model S we tested reached 60 mph in a blistering 2.4 seconds",
